# MUTE â€˜EM ALL
Your task is to attend a conference call with 99 person

All tend to talk much not even one by one

Only way to handle the session is to MUTE THEM ALL!!!

When buttons turn red, it is time to hit them

But some of them are not easy to mute, you may need to mute them multiple times

And one more thing, don't forget that you are also in the same list

If you mute your self.... GAME OVER

After cloning the repository, install dependencies:

### API

```sh
npm run api-dev
